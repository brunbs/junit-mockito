# junit-mockito

The objective of this repository is to study JUnit and Mockito, from basic to advanced.
I made this so I can practice more (and learn more, of course) but also in a way that a beginner can use as a model of study.
If you are a beginner, you can study commit by commit because it has increasingly concepts.

I'll be improving some concepts in the Theory.md file, so check it out from time to time

Hope anyone who sees here can enjoy :)

Any questions or suggestions, contact me.
