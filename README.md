# junit-mockito
Udemy JUnit and Mockito Course

The objective of this repository is to study JUnit and Mockito, from basic to advanced.
I made this so I can practice more (and learn more, of course) but also in a way that a beginner can use as a model of study.

I'll be improving some concepts in the Theory.md file, so check it out from time to time

Hope anyone who sees here can enjoy :)

Any questions or suggestions, contact me.
